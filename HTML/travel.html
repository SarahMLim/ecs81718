        Sometimes my family visits my uncle in Pittsburgh.  There is a lot of fun things to do there.  Last summer, we went to the Frank Lloyd Wright house, Falling Water.  It was very interesting, but I definitely wouldn't want to live there.  We also rode the incline, which is a car on a track that takes you up the side of a mountain so you can see the scenery below.  There are three rivers that all come together in Pittsburgh, and my family took a boat tour on the rivers.  We also rode some alpine slides, which are these sleds on wheels that twist and turn down a ski slope (in the summer).  You can control the speed with a hand brake.  I raced my cousin!

        My family likes to go on cave tours.  It's pretty cool to go so far underground and see all the different cave formations.  It's interesting because different caves look so different from each other.  For example, some have a lot of stalagmites and stalactites and some have cool crystal formations.  We went into one cave that had a lot of little bats clinging to the walls.  We have visited caves in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Minnesota.

        For spring break last year my family went to Arizona.  We rented a car and drove to a lot of fun places including the Grand Canyon, the Petrified Forest, Sedona, Lake Powell and Pheonix.  The Grand Canyon was my favorite of the places.  My cousin didn't really like it though because he is really scared of heights.  I also really liked Lake Powell because we went on a rafting trip on the Colorado River.

    <h2 class="dark_blue arial" style="clear:both;">Antigua</h2>
    <p class="dark_blue border">
        My family went to Antigua, which is a small island in the Caribbean.  We rented a house near the beach and went snorkeling every day.  We saw a lot of cool fish including a baracuda, sea urchins, a lionfish, starfish, stingrays and lots of coral.  We also went on a zip line through the canopy of the rainforest.  We rented a car and explored the entire island, which was a little tricky because they drive on the left hand side of the road in Antigua.
