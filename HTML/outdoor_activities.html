        When we go to Minnesota at Thanksgiving time, the lake and ponds are already frozen. My family likes to play ice hockey. Most of my family plays in their shoes, but my dad and I put on our skates. My mom likes to play goalie because she doesn't have to
        run around too much. She is really good at stopping the puck with her foot! Even my grandpa plays, but one time  he got hit in the shin with a puck and it turned into a huge lump! Poor Grandpa! My aunts and some friends play too so it is usually
        about four people per team.

        My family likes to ski. We go to visit my aunt that has a condo near Deer Valley in Utah. My cousin and I went to ski school there two years in a row, so now we a pretty good at skiing. I like to ski the intermediate runs, and I ski with my cousin Elle.
        At first, my cousin was scared of the chair lifts because he doesn't like heights, but he got used to it. We also have gone skiing closer to home at Chestnut Mountain (in Illinois), Villa Olivia (in Illinois) and Wilmot (in Wisconsin). Those
        places are not anywhere near as big as Deer Valley, but it's still fun to practice for a day.

        I like to swim. My grandparents live in a place in Naperville that has an indoor swimming pool, so we swim there a lot. It's nice because the pool is almost always empty, so my brother and I get the place to ourselves. It also has a hot tub,
        so we like to switch back and forth between the hot tub and the pool. I also swim a lot in the lake at my other grandparents' lake house. That's fun because there is a diving raft that we swim out to.

    <h2 class="dark_blue" style="clear:both;">Kayaking and Canoeing</h2>

        My family owns kayaks and canoes at my grandparents lake house in Minnesota.  I like to go kayaking through the stream that feeds the lake.  You have to paddle really hard in places because it gets bogged down in weeds, but it's fun to explore.  There's a beaver lodge back there that I have stood on.  I also like to canoe on the Mississippi River.  The Mississippi starts in Minnesota very close to my grandparents' lake house, so it is a small, narrow river up there with no one else around.  It has tall pine trees lining the shores so it's very pretty.  There are lots of bald eagles and herons that fly overhead.

    <h2 class="dark_blue" style="clear:both;">Hiking</h2>

        I like to go hiking in the woods because I really like nature.  This is a picture of me with my cousin Elle and my brother Oscar walking through a bog at a Minnesota state park. It was interesting because there were carnivorous plants there like the pitcher plant and the venus flytrap.   Some other interesting places where I have gone hiking lately include the Indiana Dunes, Starved Rock and Bemidji State Park (in Minnesota).  I've seen a lot of wildlife on my walks, including deer, elk, fox, raccoon, snakes, eagles, and lots of different types of birds.
