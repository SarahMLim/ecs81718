    <h2 class="dark_blue">Oscar</h2>
    <img src="https://image.ibb.co/hz2gSc/t87XsNQ.jpg" alt="Oscar" style="width:25%; height:25%; float:right;" class="border dark_blue">
    <p class="dark_blue border" style="width:70%;">This is my closest cousin, Oscar. He is 10 years olds and is a 5th grader at South Loop Elementary. He is hoping to get into Lane Tech in 7th grade. He is smart and creative but he is also a little crazy. We get along pretty well compared to most cousins,
        but we have very different interests from each other. He sometimes annoys me but he is mostly a good cousin.

    <h2 class="dark_blue" style="clear:both;">Mom and Dad</h2>
    <img src="https://image.ibb.co/eT687c/irk7jc6.png" alt="Mom and Dad" style="width:25%; height:25%; float:left;" class="border dark_blue">
    <img src="https://image.ibb.co/fdfCYH/j9LTWtM.png" alt="Mom and Dad" style="width:25%; height:25%; float:left;" class="border dark_blue">
    <p class="dark_blue border" style="width:70%; float:right;">This is my mom and dad. My dad is a real estate lawyer. He works in the Willis Tower on the 60th floor. On windy days he can feel the whole building shaking back and forth. Some things we like to do together are ride bikes and go fishing. My mom used
        to be a financial consultant but now she is a stay at home mom. I like that because she drops me off and picks me up from school and it is nice to have at least one parent home instead of being on my own.</p>

    <h2 class="dark_blue" style="clear:both;">Ozzy</h2>
    <img src="https://image.ibb.co/bB79DH/NpYqP3J.png" alt="Ozzy" style="width:25%; height:25%; float:right;" class="border dark_blue">
    <p class="dark_blue border" style="width:70%;">
        This is my cat Ozzy. I named him Ozzy because he thought Ozzy looked like an ocelot and they both start with O. He is a year and a half old and he has a lot of energy. He is by far the best athlete in the family.  He can jump from the floor to the top of the refrigerator! We used to let him out in the back yard but he recently learned how to climb
        the fence so we don't do that anymore. My dad didn't really want a cat but I am glad that we finally convinced him and I think he is too.

    <h2 class="dark_blue" style="clear:both;">Grandparents</h2>
    <img src="https://image.ibb.co/c749xc/thLRKvO.png" alt="Grandparents" style="width:25%; height:25%; float:left;" class="border dark_blue">
     
    <p class="dark_blue border" style="width:70%; float:right;">I am very lucky that all four of my grandparents are still alive. My dad's parents live in Minnesota in the summer and in Texas during the winter. My mom's parents live in Naperville. One of my grandpas is 92 years old and he still drives the car! My other grandpa is a really good golfer and he plays golf 4 days a week. I hope I am doing that well when I am that age.
        We spend a lot of time with my dad's parents in the summer because they live on a lake.</p>

    <h2 class="dark_blue" style="clear:both;">Extended Family</h2>
    <img src="https://image.ibb.co/gThWSc/T0Rxfw3.jpg" alt="Extended family" style="width:25%; height:25%; float:right;" class="border dark_blue">
    <p class="dark_blue border" style="width:70%;">In addition to my immediate family, I have a large extended family. My mom has two brothers and my dad has two sisters. One of my uncles on my mom&rsquo; side of the family has nine children, so in total I have 13 first cousins! Most of my cousins
        are already grown with families of their own, so if I include all of my cousins&rsquo; children in the count, then I have over 30 cousins! The cousin I see most is Elle from San Diego. She is eleven, which is the same age as my brother Oscar,
        and I see her a lot because she spends a lot of time with us at my grandparents&rsquo; lake house in the summers in Minnesota. Even though I have such a large extended family, no one else besides us live in Chicago. The closest is my grandparents
        in Naperville, but most of my cousins live in different states.
