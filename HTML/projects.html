    <h2 class="dark_blue">Wood Burning Projects</h2>

        This is a picture of some things I made using a wood burning tool.  I usually draw the design first in pencil on the wood, and then use the wood burning tool to trace the design.  You have to have a lot of patience and go very slowly in order to do a good job at wood burning.   I have done a lot of cool projects, including signs, a birdhouse and a lot of pictures.  It's fun to give wood burning projects to people as gifts because you can customize things with their name or something they like to make a more personalized gift.

    <h2 class="dark_blue" style="clear:both;">Treehouse</h2>

        This is a picture of a tree house I made with my grandpa in the woods on his property in Minnesota.  We made the whole thing in one day!  It is just a platform with stairs leading up, but it was challenging because it is so high off the ground.  We went way back in the woods to find a good tree with three trunks that would support the platform between them.  My grandpa has a Bobcat tractor, so that was very helpful for hauling the supplies. It was hard to get my cousin to go up in it at first because he is afraid of height, but he finally made it.  My grandma made us put a railing around the platform because she was very afraid we would fall out.  Good idea, Grandma!

        This is a picture of my cousin launching a water balloon in our homemade slingshot!  We got the idea after visiting a carnival where there was a much smaller water balloon launcher.  It&rsquo;s just a big A-frame made out of wood.  We put hinges on the top so that it can collapse for easy storage.  We used surgical tubing and a funnel for the slingshot.  We made two of them so that we could have water balloon wars across a big open field on my grandparents&rsquo; property at their lake resort.  The water balloons can seriously fly 100 meters or more!  This was a really fun project!

    <h2 class="dark_blue" style="clear:both;">3D Design and Printing</h2>
    <p class="dark_blue border">
        These are some pictures of things that I designed and printed.  I have used several 3D design software applications, including Tinkercad, 123D and Blender.  I have a 3D printer at home. It's a Flashforge Dreamer with dual extruders so you can print in two colors.  One of my favorite projects I did was designing and printing a wheelchair for a parapalegic ferret named Stanley (see picture).  He was able to get around much better using the wheelchair.  Another favorite project was a 3D model of the Willis Tower for my dad because he works in that building.  I made the 60th floor (his floor) a different color and put his name and company logo on it.  He has it on his desk at work.

    <h2 class="dark_blue" style="clear:both;">Kids Fort</h2>

    <p class="dark_blue border" style="width:70%; float:right;">
        This is a picture of a fort that my mom helped me build on the side of our house.  We made the four sides and the floor separately on our driveway, and then we put them together on the side of our house where it is a tight fit between our garage and the building next door to us.  It took several days.  Making the door so that it would close tightly was the most challenging part.  When we first made it, my cousin and I used to go in there all the tibrotherme to hang out or read books.  We had carpeting and two chairs, lights and blankets.  We put a lock on the door and told the combination only to a few close friends who were allowed in the "club". Now that we are a little older, we don't use it that much anymore so my mom started using it as a storage shed during the winter.  I learned a lot about building from that project.
