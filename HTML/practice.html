    <p>Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani activist for female education and openly spoke out against the Taliban's plans to limit female education.<br></br>
    <b>She advocated for equal education opportunities because she experienced discrimination for going to school just because she was female.</b><br></br>
    Through her speeches and activism, she inspired many girls to stand up for themselves and to believe that they are just as equal as boys in their right to an education.</p>
