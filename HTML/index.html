    <p class="dark_blue border">This is a website all about me - Sarah Lim! I am a 8th grader at Lane Tech. Before starting at Lane, I attended Newberry Math and Science Academy from 2nd through 6th grade and Helen C. Peirce School from Pre-K through 1st grade. Both are public schools. I was
        able to take the bus to school every day and only one other kid from Newberry made it into Lane in my grade. I don't remember much about Perice but one thing that is unique about Newberry is it had a sort of family feel. Everyone knew each other and you could really be yourself. It was very different from Lane.  I liked it there a lot, but I was also very happy the day that
        I found out I got into Lane, especially because they do not offer any computer classes at my old school!
